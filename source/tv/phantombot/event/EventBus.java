/**
 * Sends events to downstream subscribers
 * <p>
 * To subscribe to an event, a Java class must be non-static, implement {@link Listener}, have a public method for each desired event
 * with the signature {@code public void methodName(EventClass event)} where {@code EventClass} is the class of the event to be
 * captured, have the {@code @net.engio.mbassy.listener.Handler} annotation applied to each event handler method, and must call
 * {@link #register(Listener)} for each instance of the class that should receive events
 * <p>
 * The event bus will deliver each event to all subscribers of the matching event class, as well as subscribers of any event class in
 * the parent chain going back up to the {@link Event} base class. For example: subscribing to {@link JVMEvent} will receive all
 * events in the {@code tv.phantombot.event.jvm} package, as it is the base event for the package
